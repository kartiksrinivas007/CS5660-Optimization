\subsection*{Mirror Descent}
The function $\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{p} \| x \|_p^p$ is strongly convex with a parameter.

The map used in the problem takes the gradients to a different space namely the dual space of the system. 
The question is, what exactly is the norm that is being used on both of the sides.

The update equation is based on the fenchel conjugate of the function and is as follows
\begin{equation}
    \nabla w^*(y) = \text{argmax}_{x \in X} \langle x, y \rangle - w(x)
\end{equation}
Using this we get 
\begin{gather*}
    \nabla w^*(y) = \text{argmax}_{x \in X} \langle x, y \rangle - \frac{1}{p} \| x \|_p^p 
    \\
    y = \nabla_x \frac{\sum |x^*_j|^p}{p} \\
    \\
    y_j = |x^*_j|^{p-1} \text{sgn}(x_j) \\
    \\
    x_j^* = |y_j|^{1/(p-1)} \text{sgn}(y_j)
\end{gather*}

Therefore the update step is 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mirror_descent}
    x_{t+1} =  | \nabla w(x_t) - \eta \nabla f(x_t) |^{\frac{1}{p-1}} \text{sgn}(\nabla w(x_t) - \eta \nabla f(x_t))
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Proximal Mirror Descent}

For the proximal case the only additional update in the equation comes through the regularized norm  $\mu \| x \|_1$
The additional gradient is $\mu \text{ sgn }(x)$, which gets added to yield 

$$
y_j = \text{sgn}(x_j) ( \mu +  |x_j^*|^{p-1} )
$$

Hence we get 

$$
    x_j = \text{sgn}(y_j) \max(0, |y_j| - \mu)^{\frac{1}{p-1}}
$$

Note how the optimal solution to the problem can be seen component wise, since the function $\frac{1}{p} \| x \|^p$ can be broken component-wise into several parts.
The argmax would be a cartesian product of each component wise optimal $x_j^*$. The stationary point will exist only when $|y_j| \le \mu$


\begin{align*}
    f'(x_j) &= \nabla_{x_j} (x_jy_j  - \frac{1}{p} |x_j|^p - |x_j|) \\\
    &= y_j - |x_j|^{p-1} - \text{sgn}(x_j) \\
    &= \begin{cases} 
        < 0 & x_j\leq 0, |y_j| < \mu \\
        > 0  & x_j \geq 0, |y_j| < \mu  \\
     \end{cases}\\
    &= 0 \text{ if } |y_j| \ge \mu \text{ and } y_j = \text{sgn}(x_j) ( \mu + |x_j|^{p-1})\\
\end{align*}

In our case the proxy for $\mu$ is the multilication of the step size $\eta$ and the regularization weight $\lambda$, i.e $\mu = \lambda \eta$

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq: psmd}
    x_{t + 1} = \text{sgn}(\nabla w(x_t) - \eta \nabla f(x_t)) \max(0, |\nabla w(x_t) - \eta \nabla f(x_t)| - \lambda \eta)^{\frac{1}{p-1}}
\end{equation}

where $\nabla w(x) = |x|^{p-1} \text{sgn}(x)$
