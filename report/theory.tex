\section*{Theoretical Results}

The function $\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{p} \| x \|_p^p$ is strongly convex with a parameter.

The map used in the problem takes the gradients to a different space namely the dual space of the system. 
The question is, what exactly is the norm that is being used on both of the sides.

The update equation is based on the fenchel conjugate of the function and is as follows
\begin{equation}
    \nabla w^*(y) = \text{argmax}_{x \in X} \langle x, y \rangle - w(x)
\end{equation}
Using this we get 
\begin{gather*}
    \nabla w^*(y) = \text{argmax}_{x \in X} \langle x, y \rangle - \frac{1}{p} \| x \|_p^p 
    \\
    y = \nabla_x \frac{\sum |x^*_j|^p}{p} \\
    \\
    y_j = |x^*_j|^{p-1} \text{sgn}(x_j) \\
    \\
    x_j^* = |y_j|^{1/(p-1)} \text{sgn}(y_j)
\end{gather*}

Therefore the update step is 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mirror_descent}
    x_{t+1} =  | \nabla w(x_t) - \eta \nabla f(x_t) |^{\frac{1}{p-1}} \text{sgn}(\nabla w(x_t) - \eta \nabla f(x_t))
\end{equation}
